## Abstract

This specification adds Cardano mainnet support to the Open Wallet Standard (OWS)
reference implementation while preserving OWS's chain-agnostic, local-first design.
It introduces the `cip34` CAIP-2 namespace and registers Cardano mainnet, preprod,
and preview networks with canonical chain identifiers, a coin type, and default
(keyless) Koios RPC endpoints. On the cryptographic side, it adds a new
`Ed25519Bip32` curve (Ed25519-V2 / BIP32-Ed25519) implemented generically via the
`ed25519-bip32` crate, together with the Cardano Icarus master-key scheme and
CIP-1852 hierarchical derivation. Cardano accounts are derived from two credentials
— a payment credential (`role = 0`) and a stake credential (`role = 2`) — which
diverges from OWS's prior assumption that one account maps to a single derivation
path; the key-storage and derivation layers were extended to carry the two
96-byte extended private keys required to assemble a Shelley base address. On top
of this foundation, the chain plugin interface (`ChainSigner`) is fully
implemented: Shelley **base**, **enterprise**, and **reward** address encoding;
raw Ed25519 signing; CIP-8 message signing (COSE `COSE_Sign1` structures); and
transaction signing that produces and CBOR-encodes the `Vkeywitness`es required to
make a transaction submittable. Address encoding, transaction (de)serialization,
and witness construction use `cardano-serialization-lib` (CSL), while the COSE
message structures use Emurgo's `cardano-message-signing` companion library.
Finally, it wires Cardano into the OWS Policy Engine: `make_transaction_context`
parses an unsigned transaction (CBOR) and, because UTxO inputs carry no value,
resolves them through the configured Koios RPC provider to compute per-address ADA
and native-asset flows (`TransactionEffect`s) that built-in and executable policies
can evaluate before a key is used.

## Motivation

OWS already supports Ed25519 chains (Solana, TON, NEAR) using SLIP-10 derivation,
and secp256k1 chains using BIP-32. Cardano cannot reuse either path:

- **Curve / derivation scheme.** Cardano uses BIP32-Ed25519 ("Ed25519-V2"),
  which extends a 64-byte Ed25519 extended secret key with a 32-byte chain code
  (96 bytes total) and supports both hardened and **non-hardened** child
  derivation. SLIP-10 ed25519 (used by Solana et al.) is hardened-only and is not
  compatible with Cardano wallets.
- **Master key generation.** Cardano (Icarus) derives the root key from the raw
  BIP-39 **entropy** via PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512, not from the BIP-39 _seed_ used by
  BIP-32 / SLIP-10.
- **Multi-credential addresses.** A Cardano Shelley address is built from two
  independent credentials at two different CIP-1852 derivation paths (payment and
  stake). OWS previously assumed a single derivation path produces a single
  address.
- **Identifier namespace.** Cardano is not an EVM/`eip155`, `solana`, `cosmos`,
  etc. chain; it needs its own CAIP-2 namespace and a deterministic chain
  identifier.

The existing abstractions (`Curve`, `HdDeriver`, `ChainType`, `Chain`,
`ChainSigner`) therefore had to be extended rather than reused as-is.

## Analysis, Architecture, and Setup

### Cryptographic stack

OWS already ships a broad cryptographic toolkit in `ows-signer`. The relevant
existing primitives and the libraries that provide them:

| Concern                       | Library (crate)                          | Used by / notes                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| secp256k1 ECDSA               | `k256`                                   | EVM, Bitcoin, Cosmos, Tron, XRPL, Spark, Filecoin |
| BIP-32 derivation (secp256k1) | `coins-bip32`                            | all secp256k1 families                            |
| Ed25519 signatures            | `ed25519-dalek`                          | Solana, TON, Sui, NEAR                            |
| SLIP-10 ed25519 derivation    | in-house (HMAC-SHA512 over `hmac`/`sha2`)| hardened-only ed25519 families                    |
| BIP-39 mnemonics              | `coins-bip39`                            | seed + entropy extraction                         |
| Hashing                       | `sha2`, `sha3`, `ripemd`, `blake2`       | address + tx hashing across families              |
| Address encodings             | `bech32`, `bs58` (+check), `base64`      | segwit/bech32, base58check, etc.                  |
| At-rest encryption            | `aes-gcm` + `scrypt`/`hkdf` (`CryptoEnvelope`) | encrypted wallet files                      |
| Secret hygiene                | `zeroize` (`SecretBytes`)                | all key material is zeroized on drop              |

Cardano introduces two additional, Cardano-specific dependencies:

- **`ed25519-bip32` (0.4.1)** — BIP32-Ed25519 ("Ed25519-V2") key derivation:
  96-byte extended private keys (`XPRV_SIZE`), `DerivationScheme::V2`, hardened
  **and** non-hardened children, and `normalize_bytes_force3rd` for valid root
  keys. Chosen so derivation stays in the generic `HdDeriver`, rather than pulling
  a full chain SDK into the key path.
- **`cardano-serialization-lib` (CSL, 14.1.2)** — the canonical Cardano library
  for network parameters (`NetworkInfo`), address construction
  (`BaseAddress`/`EnterpriseAddress`/`RewardAddress`, `Credential`), public-key
  hashing (`PublicKey`), witness construction (`Vkey`, `Ed25519Signature`,
  `Vkeywitness`), and CBOR transaction (de)serialization (`FixedTransaction`). It
  is used for network parameters, Shelley address encoding, and transaction
  signing/witness encoding. Only public halves are handed to CSL: the secret stays
  in `ed25519-bip32`'s `XPrv`, so CSL's private-key types are not used at all (see
  [Security Considerations](#security-considerations)).
  Note CSL also pulls in `pbkdf2`, which we use directly for the Icarus master-key
  step.
- **`emurgo-cardano-message-signing` (1.1.0)** — Emurgo's COSE companion to CSL,
  used exclusively for CIP-8 message signing. It provides the `COSESign1Builder`,
  `HeaderMap`/`Headers`/`ProtectedHeaderMap`/`Label`, `AlgorithmId::EdDSA`, and
  `SignedMessage`/CBOR helpers needed to build and serialize the COSE `Sig_structure`
  and `COSE_Sign1` payload that Cardano wallets expect.

### Peculiarities of Cardano vs. other OWS chains

Several ways Cardano departs from chains already supported in OWS, each of which
drove a specific design decision later in this document:

1. **Extended-key derivation (96 bytes, V2).** Unlike SLIP-10 ed25519
   (32-byte keys, hardened-only) or BIP-32 secp256k1, Cardano uses BIP32-Ed25519
   with 64-byte extended secret keys + a 32-byte chain code, and allows
   **non-hardened** derivation. This is a new `Curve`, not a tweak to an existing
   one.
2. **Master key from entropy, not seed.** Most chains derive from the BIP-39
   *seed* (PBKDF2 over the mnemonic phrase). Cardano's Icarus scheme derives the
   root key from the raw BIP-39 **entropy** (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512, entropy as salt,
   4096 iterations, and a password slot that OWS leaves empty — see
   [§2.2](#22-master-key-generation-icarus)). Reusing the seed would yield
   addresses no Icarus-scheme wallet could reproduce.
3. **Two credentials per address.** A Shelley **base** address combines a payment
   credential (CIP-1852 `role = 0`) and a stake credential (`role = 2`), each at
   its own derivation path. OWS's "one path → one address" assumption does not
   hold; the key-storage layer carries 192 bytes (payment ‖ stake).
4. **CIP-1852 purpose, not BIP-44.** Cardano uses purpose `1852'` (not `44'`)
   with coin type `1815'`, and a `role` segment between account and index.
5. **CAIP-2 via CIP-34.** The chain identifier encodes both a network id and a
   network magic (`cip34:<networkId>-<networkMagic>`), rather than a single
   numeric/string reference.
6. **CBOR transactions + keyless RPC.** Transactions are CBOR (parsed and
   witness-encoded by CSL's `FixedTransaction`); the default RPC provider is
   keyless Koios, with submission via a binary `POST /submittx`.
7. **COSE message signing (CIP-8).** Unlike most OWS chains, which sign a hashed
   or prefixed byte string, Cardano message signing follows CIP-8: the message is
   wrapped in a COSE `COSE_Sign1` structure whose protected headers carry the
   signing address, and the signature is over the COSE `Sig_structure`, not the
   raw message.

and the in-repo [`docs/07-supported-chains.md`](07-supported-chains.md).

## Specification

### 1. CAIP-2 / CAIP-10 addressing

#### 1.1 Namespace and chain identifiers

Cardano is identified with the **`cip34`** CAIP-2 namespace, following
[CIP-34](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-34). The CIP-34 reference encodes the
network as `<networkId>-<networkMagic>`:

| Network | OWS name          | CAIP-2 chain id     | networkId | networkMagic |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| Mainnet | `cardano`         | `cip34:1-764824073` | 1         | 764824073    |
| Preprod | `cardano-preprod` | `cip34:0-1`         | 0         | 1            |
| Preview | `cardano-preview` | `cip34:0-2`         | 0         | 2            |

A new `ChainType::Cardano` variant is added to the chain-family enum
(`ows/crates/ows-core/src/chain.rs`). The namespace mapping is wired in both directions:

- `ChainType::Cardano.namespace()` → `"cip34"`
- `ChainType::from_namespace("cip34")` → `Some(ChainType::Cardano)`
- `ChainType::Cardano.default_coin_type()` → `1815` (SLIP-44 coin type for ADA)

The three networks above are registered in `KNOWN_CHAINS`, so `parse_chain`
resolves both friendly names (`cardano`, `cardano-preprod`, `cardano-preview`) and
raw CAIP-2 ids (`cip34:1-764824073`, `cip34:0-1`, `cip34:0-2`). `cardano` is the
first Cardano entry in the registry, so it is the default for the family
(`default_chain_for_type(ChainType::Cardano)` → mainnet).

#### 1.2 CAIP-10 accounts

CAIP-10 account identifiers follow the existing OWS convention
`chain_id:address`, e.g.

```
cip34:1-764824073:addr1...
```

The account id is assembled in `derive_all_accounts` as
`format!("{}:{}", chain.chain_id, address)`, identical to every other family.

#### 1.3 Universal wallet membership

`ChainType::Cardano` is appended to `ALL_CHAIN_TYPES`. Because a
universal wallet derives one account per family plus the explicitly listed
testnet extras, Cardano contributes three rows:

- `UNIVERSAL_WALLET_EXTRA_CHAIN_NAMES = ["cardano-preprod", "cardano-preview"]`
- `universal_wallet_chains()` therefore yields mainnet (via the family default)
  plus the two testnets, in a stable order.

#### 1.4 RPC configuration (Koios, keyless)

OWS does not currently support authenticated RPC providers, so the default
provider is **Koios**, which offers a keyless free tier. Default endpoints are
registered in `Config::default_rpc()`:

| Chain id            | Default RPC                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `cip34:1-764824073` | `https://api.koios.rest/api/v1`     |
| `cip34:0-1`         | `https://preprod.koios.rest/api/v1` |
| `cip34:0-2`         | `https://preview.koios.rest/api/v1` |

RPC resolution reuses the generic precedence already in place: explicit override
→ user config exact `chain_id` → user config namespace match → built-in default.

#### 1.5 Signer resolution

`signer_for_chain` constructs `CardanoSigner::from_chain_id(chain.chain_id)`, which
selects network parameters from the CAIP-2 id — `cip34:1-764824073` → mainnet,
`cip34:0-1` → preprod, `cip34:0-2` → preview — and **rejects any other reference**
with `SignerError::UnsupportedChain`. Network parameters come from
`cardano-serialization-lib`'s `NetworkInfo`.

Rejecting is not a formality: `parse_chain` accepts any reference under a known
namespace (`cip34:0-999` parses), so an unsupported network does reach this
constructor. On EVM the chain id is signed into the transaction, so a wrong network
cannot yield a signature that is valid elsewhere; on Cardano the network lives in the
address header byte and is chosen here, so a fallback to mainnet would derive mainnet
addresses and produce real mainnet signatures for a caller who asked for a testnet.
A rejected reference is never signed with, transmitted or turned into an address. How
early it fails depends on the path: the paths that build a transaction context
(`sign_with_api_key`, `sign_and_send` in agent mode, `sign_encode_and_broadcast`,
`sign_hash_with_credential`) construct the signer before resolving an RPC URL, before
the policy context and before the key; the owner-mode signing paths and the api-key
message and hash paths derive the key first and reject after it.
This is why `signer_for_chain` and `signer_for_chain_type` return
`Result<Box<dyn ChainSigner>, SignerError>`.

### 2. Key derivation and cryptography

#### 2.1 New curve

A third `Curve` variant, `Ed25519Bip32`, is added (`ows/crates/ows-signer/src/curve.rs`):

- `private_key_len()` → `ed25519_bip32::XPRV_SIZE` (96 bytes: 64-byte extended
  secret key + 32-byte chain code)
- `public_key_len()` → 32 bytes

#### 2.2 Master key generation (Icarus)

For `Curve::Ed25519Bip32`, `HdDeriver::derive_from_mnemonic` does **not** use the
BIP-39 seed. Instead it follows the Cardano Icarus scheme
(`ed25519_bip32_master_xprv_from_entropy`):

1. Extract the raw BIP-39 **entropy** (checksum bits excluded) from the mnemonic.
   `Mnemonic::entropy()` was added for this purpose.
2. `PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512` with an **empty password**, the entropy as the **salt**,
   `4096` iterations, producing a 96-byte output. CIP-3 specifies the step as
   `generateMasterKey(seed, password)` and publishes vectors for the same recovery
   phrase both with no passphrase and with the passphrase `foo`, so the empty slot
   is a choice rather than something the spec requires. OWS has nothing to put
   there: it never accepts a BIP-39 passphrase (the `passphrase` it exposes is the
   vault's encryption passphrase), and every derivation call site passes `""`. The
   empty-password form is the one the published CIP-3 vector in the tests uses and
   the one a wallet holding only the mnemonic reproduces. A non-empty password
   derives a different root key and therefore a different set of addresses, so
   supporting one would mean adding a parameter here and surfacing it as an
   explicit choice — not changing this step.
3. Normalize the result with `XPrv::normalize_bytes_force3rd` to obtain a valid
   master extended private key.

This is verified against published Icarus test vectors (including the all-zero
"abandon … about" mnemonic).

#### 2.3 Child derivation

`HdDeriver::derive` accepts a 96-byte master `XPrv` for `Ed25519Bip32`
(seed-length validation requires exactly `XPRV_SIZE`; the 16–64 byte rule that
applies to secp256k1/ed25519 is bypassed). Path components are walked with the
`ed25519-bip32` crate using **`DerivationScheme::V2`**, supporting both hardened
(`'`) and non-hardened indices. The result is the 96-byte child `XPrv`.

All curves share a single path parser (`parse_path_components`), so
`validate_path` and every per-curve derivation branch agree on what a path means:
each component is `<index>` or `<index>'`, and the bare index must be **below
2³¹** (`0x80000000`). The bound matters most for Cardano, the only curve that also
accepts non-hardened components: without it `m/2147483648` and `m/0'` would derive
the same child index and be two spellings of one path. On the hardened-only
SLIP-10 branch the same parser additionally rejects any non-hardened component
(`Ed25519NonHardened`).

The deriver continues to expose the same surface for all curves:
`derive`, `derive_from_mnemonic`, and the cached `derive_from_mnemonic_cached`
(the cache key incorporates the `ed25519_bip32` curve tag so it cannot collide
with secp256k1/ed25519 keys for the same path).

#### 2.4 CIP-1852 paths

`CardanoSigner` exposes the CIP-1852 hierarchy
`m / 1852' / 1815' / account' / role / index`, where `role` is
`0` = external/payment, `1` = internal/change, `2` = stake:

| Helper                            | Path                          |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `payment_derivation_path(index)`  | `m/1852'/1815'/{index}'/0/0`  |
| `stake_derivation_path(index)`    | `m/1852'/1815'/{index}'/2/0`  |

Per the agreed scope, only **one base address per account at address index 0** is
supported initially, so the generic `index` that OWS threads through derivation is
used as the CIP-1852 **account** index and the address index stays `0`.
`default_derivation_path(index)` returns the payment leaf
(`m/1852'/1815'/{index}'/0/0`). Generic single-path key resolution no
longer derives this leaf directly; instead generic call sites use
`default_derivation_paths` and `encode_keys` (see
[§3.5](#35-key-material-abstraction-default_derivation_paths-and-encode_keys)),
which for Cardano materialize both the payment leaf and the stake key
(`m/1852'/1815'/{index}'/2/0`) as a single 192-byte buffer.

#### 2.5 `ChainSigner` integration

`CardanoSigner` implements `ChainSigner`:

- `chain_type()` → `ChainType::Cardano`
- `curve()` → `Curve::Ed25519Bip32`
- `coin_type()` → `1815`
- `default_derivation_path(index)` → payment leaf (see above)

`derive_address`, `sign`, `sign_message`, `sign_transaction`, and
`encode_signed_transaction` are now fully implemented; mnemonic key resolution uses
`default_derivation_paths` and `encode_keys` (see [§3.5](#35-key-material-abstraction-default_derivation_paths-and-encode_keys));
they are specified in [§3](#3-transaction-and-message-signing-chain-plugin-interface).
The key material these methods consume is a 192-byte buffer = payment `XPrv` (96) ‖
stake `XPrv` (96) at matching CIP-1852 indices (or a bare 96-byte payment `XPrv`,
which yields an enterprise address with no staking component).

#### 2.6 Multi-credential key storage

Because a Cardano account needs two credentials, the multi-curve key material was
extended (`ows/crates/ows-lib/src/ops.rs`):

- The `KeyPair` struct (used for raw-private-key imports) gains an
  `ed25519_bip32` field, serialized as
  `{"secp256k1":"…","ed25519":"…","ed25519_bip32":"…"}`. The `KeyType::PrivateKey`
  doc comment in `wallet_file.rs` is updated accordingly. The wallet-file schema
  version (`ows_version`) is unchanged at `2`; the new field is additive.
- For imported private-key wallets, `random_ed25519_bip32()` generates **two**
  normalized 96-byte `XPrv`s (payment ‖ stake = 192 bytes) so the layout matches
  the base-address encoding.
- `KeyPair::key_for_curve(Curve::Ed25519Bip32)` returns this material; empty
  material yields a clear "private key for chain is empty" error for wallets
  imported before Cardano support existed.
- An explicitly supplied `ed25519_bip32` key is validated at import time
  (`validate_ed25519_bip32_key` in `import_wallet_private_key`): the blob must be
  exactly 96 or 192 bytes, and each 96-byte half must pass
  `XPrv::from_slice_verified`, i.e. satisfy the Ed25519-BIP32 scalar clamping
  rules. A malformed key is rejected with an `InvalidInput` error naming the
  offending half (`payment` / `stake`) instead of being stored and failing later
  at signing time.
- Mnemonic wallets reach the same 192-byte layout through `default_derivation_paths`
  and `encode_keys` (see
  [§3.5](#35-key-material-abstraction-default_derivation_paths-and-encode_keys)) rather than through
  `KeyPair`, so both wallet kinds present an identical payment ‖ stake buffer to the
  signer.

#### 2.7 Broadcast plumbing

`broadcast` dispatches `ChainType::Cardano` to `broadcast_cardano`, which POSTs the
raw CBOR transaction to Koios `{rpc}/submittx` (`Content-Type: application/cbor`),
expects HTTP `202`, and validates the returned 32-byte hexadecimal transaction ID
against the BLAKE2b-256 hash of the original transaction body being submitted.
`CardanoSigner::transaction_id` computes that ID from the preserved CBOR body,
excluding witnesses and auxiliary data, after applying the CBOR parser guards.
The response may be a JSON string or bare hex; surrounding whitespace and hex case
are normalized. Malformed and mismatched IDs return `BroadcastFailed` instead of a
successful result. This is response validation, not confirmation: the provider may
already have submitted the transaction before returning an invalid response. Check
the locally computed expected ID (included in the validation error) before retrying.
The fully signed CBOR produced by `encode_signed_transaction`
(see [§3.4](#34-transaction-signing)) is
what feeds this path.

### 3. Transaction and message signing (Chain Plugin Interface)

This deliverable implements the `ChainSigner` plugin surface for Cardano:
address encoding, raw signing, CIP-8 message signing, and transaction
signing/witness encoding. Address construction, transaction (de)serialization, and
witness encoding use `cardano-serialization-lib` (CSL); COSE message structures use
Emurgo's `cardano-message-signing` companion crate.

All signer methods accept the **key material** layout described in
[§2.5](#25-chainsigner-integration): either a 192-byte payment `XPrv` ‖ stake
`XPrv`, or a bare 96-byte payment `XPrv`. One small private helper slices this
buffer:

- `decode_keys(key_material)` → `(payment XPrv, Option<stake XPrv>)`. It accepts 96
  or 192 bytes — anything else is a clear `InvalidPrivateKey` error — and yields
  `Some(stake)` only for the 192-byte layout.

#### 3.1 Shelley address encoding

`derive_address` chooses the address kind from whether a stake key is present:

| Key material            | Address kind | Helper                          | Example prefix |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| payment ‖ stake (192 B) | base         | `base_address_bech32`           | `addr1q…`      |
| payment only (96 B)     | enterprise   | `enterprise_address_bech32`     | `addr1v…`      |
| stake only (signing)    | reward       | `reward_address_bech32`         | `stake1…`      |

Each helper hashes the relevant public key (`public_key(xprv)?.hash()`),
wraps it in a `Credential::from_keyhash`, builds the matching CSL address type
(`BaseAddress` / `EnterpriseAddress` / `RewardAddress`) bound to the signer's
`network_id`, and bech32-encodes it. The reward address is not produced by
`derive_address` directly; it is used during message signing when a stake/reward
address is the requested signer.

#### 3.2 Raw signing (`sign`)

`sign` produces a bare 64-byte Ed25519 signature over the supplied bytes using the
**payment** key, returning the signature plus the payment public key. It performs
no hashing or prefixing (the caller decides what to sign) and is the low-level
primitive used by transaction witnessing.

#### 3.3 CIP-8 message signing (`sign_message`)

`sign_message` follows [CIP-8](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-8): the message is
embedded in a COSE `COSE_Sign1` structure and the signature is computed over the
COSE `Sig_structure`, not the raw message. The flow:

1. **Select the signing credential from the optional `address`.** The address (a
   bech32 string) determines which key signs and is embedded in the protected
   headers:
   - `Reward` (`stake1…`) → sign with the **stake** key; requires 192-byte
     material, else `InvalidPrivateKey`.
   - `Base` (`addr1q…`) → sign with the **payment** key; also requires the stake
     key so the base address can be reconstructed and verified.
   - `Enterprise` (`addr1v…`) → sign with the **payment** key.
   - Any other address kind → `AddressMismatch`.
   In each case the signer **re-derives** the address from the key material and
   compares it to the requested one, returning `AddressMismatch` on any
   discrepancy. This guarantees the embedded `address` header is one the key
   actually controls.
2. **No `address` supplied** → sign with the payment key and embed the address
   derived from the key material (base if a stake key is present, else
   enterprise).
3. **Build the COSE structure.** A `HeaderMap` of protected headers is populated
   with `AlgorithmId::EdDSA` and an `"address"` label whose value is the **raw
   address bytes** (CBOR byte string). A `COSESign1Builder` is constructed over
   these headers and the message payload; `make_data_to_sign()` yields the
   `Sig_structure`, which is signed with the selected raw Ed25519 key.
4. **Serialize.** The signature is folded back into the builder, wrapped as a
   `SignedMessage::new_cose_sign1`, and serialized to CBOR. `SignOutput.signature`
   is the serialized `COSE_Sign1`; `public_key` is the signing key's public key
   wrapped in a serialized **`COSE_Key`** (`EdDSA25519Key::new(raw_pubkey).build()`,
   CBOR-encoded — `kty: OKP`, `alg: EdDSA`, `crv: Ed25519`, `x: <32-byte key>`),
   not the bare 32 raw bytes. This is the `key` half of the `(signature, key)`
   pair CIP-30's `signData` returns, so a CIP-8 verifier can consume the output
   directly.

#### 3.4 Transaction signing

`sign_transaction` consumes the unsigned transaction CBOR (it does **not** build
transactions — input selection, fees, and change are the caller's responsibility):

1. Parse the bytes into a CSL `FixedTransaction` (`InvalidTransaction` on failure).
2. Always create a payment witness with `vkey_witness(tx_hash, payment_xprv)`.
3. Determine whether the body needs a **stake** signature. Two independent sources
   are consulted:
   - **Structural requirements** (`stake_key_hashes_required_by_body`) — the key
     hashes the ledger will demand regardless of what the builder declared:
     - **certificate stake credentials** (`add_cert_key_hashes`), covering the
       Conway `reg_cert` (a legacy `stake_registration` with no explicit deposit
       needs no witness, so it is skipped), stake deregistration, stake/vote
       delegation and the combined registration+delegation certificates, and vote
       delegation — mirroring the stake-credential arms of the ledger's
       `witsVKeyNeeded`. Script credentials are witnessed by the script, not a
       vkey, so only key-hash credentials are collected. Pool **owners** on a pool
       registration are stake key hashes and are collected; the pool operator's
       cold key, genesis delegates, committee credentials, and DRep credentials
       can never be a CIP-1852 stake key and are not.
     - **withdrawals** — the reward account of every withdrawal in the body.
   - **`required_signers`** — consulted only to decide whether *this* wallet's
     stake key should sign, never to decide that a stake key is missing: a hash
     listed there routinely belongs to a co-signer.
4. If stake key material is present and its hash is in either set, a stake witness
   is appended. If **no** stake key is available but the body structurally requires
   a stake signature for anything other than the payment credential,
   `sign_transaction` fails with `InvalidTransaction` rather than returning a
   transaction that would fail phase-1 validation on submission.
5. `SignOutput.signature` is the CBOR-encoded **`Vkeywitnesses` set** (payment,
   optionally followed by stake); `public_key` is the payment witness's public key.

`encode_signed_transaction` assembles the submittable transaction: it re-parses the
unsigned CBOR into a `FixedTransaction`, decodes the signature buffer back into a
`Vkeywitnesses` set (`Vkeywitnesses::from_bytes`), adds each witness with
`add_vkey_witness`, and returns the CBOR of the now-witnessed transaction.
This is the byte string handed to `broadcast_cardano` ([§2.7](#27-broadcast-plumbing)).

#### 3.5 Key-material abstraction (`default_derivation_paths` and `encode_keys`)

To let a chain decide how mnemonic-derived key material is shaped, `ChainSigner`
exposes two overridable hooks:

- `default_derivation_paths(index)` — all BIP paths bound to one account. The
  default returns a single-element vector containing `default_derivation_path(index)`,
  so every other chain is unaffected.
- `encode_keys(keys)` — packs the resolved key bundle into the single opaque blob
  that signing methods consume. The default returns the primary (first) key
  unchanged.

`CardanoSigner` overrides both: `default_derivation_paths` returns the payment leaf
`m/1852'/1815'/{index}'/0/0` and the stake key `m/1852'/1815'/{index}'/2/0`;
`encode_keys` concatenates the two 96-byte `XPrv`s into the 192-byte payment ‖
stake buffer the address and signing methods expect. Generic call sites were
migrated to this pattern — `derive_all_accounts`, `secret_to_signing_key`,
`derive_address` (the public lib function), the CLI `derive` command, and the
signer integration test now call `signer.default_derivation_paths(index)`, derive
keys via `HdDeriver`, then `signer.encode_keys(&keys)` instead of deriving a single
path inline. This is what lets Cardano transparently carry two credentials through
code that still assumes "one account → one key blob".

#### 3.6 Address-aware `sign_message` across all chains

CIP-8 needs to know *which* of a wallet's Cardano addresses a signature is for, so
the `sign_message` signature gained an `address: Option<&str>` parameter across the
whole `ChainSigner` trait, every chain implementation, the `ows-lib` entry points
(`sign_message`, `sign_typed_data`, and their API-key variants), the CLI (a new
`--address` flag on `sign message`), and the Node/Python bindings.

For non-Cardano chains the parameter is an optional safety check: a new default
trait method `verify_sign_message_address` re-derives the address from the private
key and compares it (case-insensitively, ignoring a `0x` prefix) to the requested
one, returning the new `SignerError::AddressMismatch` on a mismatch. Each chain
calls it at the top of `sign_message` (and EVM's typed-data path calls it too), so
passing an `address` that the key does not control is rejected everywhere, while
passing `None` keeps the prior behavior. Cardano does not use the default check —
it performs richer, address-kind-aware selection and verification inline (see
[§3.3](#33-cip-8-message-signing-sign_message)).

### 4. Policy engine support

OWS gates every signing request through a **Policy Engine**: before a key is
decrypted and used, the request is turned into a chain-agnostic
`PolicyContext` (`ows/crates/ows-core/src/policy.rs`) that built-in rules and custom
**executable** policies evaluate and can veto. The core of that context is a
`TransactionContext`, whose `effects` field is a list of per-address asset
deltas:

```rust
pub struct TransactionEffect {
    pub address: String,
    pub diff: Vec<(String, String)>, // (asset_id, signed decimal change)
}

pub struct TransactionContext {
    pub effects: Vec<TransactionEffect>,
    pub raw_hex: String,          // the raw unsigned transaction
    pub data: Option<String>,     // calldata (EVM only)
    pub chain_extra: Option<serde_json::Value>, // chain-specific detail effects cannot carry
}
```

Each `ChainSigner` produces this context from raw transaction bytes via
`make_transaction_context(tx_bytes, rpc_url)`. The trait's default implementation
returns empty `effects` (just the `raw_hex`), which suffices for chains where the
transaction already carries enough information — or where flow analysis is not yet
implemented. This deliverable overrides it for Cardano so that a policy can reason
about the **actual ADA and native-asset movement** a transaction causes, per
address.

#### 4.1 Why Cardano needs the RPC provider

Cardano is UTxO-based. A transaction body lists its inputs only as
`(transaction_hash, index)` references — it does **not** carry the value or assets
locked at those UTxOs. To compute how much each address gains or loses, the signer
must resolve every referenced input to its underlying UTxO. This is the
architectural consequence flagged in the scope: unlike the account-based effects on
other chains, building a Cardano `TransactionContext` **depends on network access**
to the configured RPC provider (Koios).

Accordingly, `make_transaction_context` takes an `Option<&str>` RPC URL, and the
`ows-lib` call sites that build the policy context — `sign_and_send`
(`ops.rs`) and `sign_with_api_key` (`key_ops.rs`) — resolve the endpoint and pass
it through. Which chains need one is a property of the signer,
`ChainSigner::transaction_context_needs_rpc` (default `false`, `true` for
`CardanoSigner`), rather than a `ChainType` match at each call site: the next chain
whose context depends on network access overrides the method instead of extending
two conditions. Resolution reuses the generic precedence
(explicit override → config exact `chain_id` → config namespace → built-in
default; see [§1.4](#14-rpc-configuration-koios-keyless)); `resolve_rpc_url` was
made `pub(crate)`-visible for this. For every chain that does not ask for a URL it
stays `None`, so no network call is introduced anywhere else.

#### 4.2 Parsing and input resolution (Koios `tx_cbor`)

`CardanoSigner::make_transaction_context` (`ows/crates/ows-signer/src/chains/cardano.rs`):

1. Parse the bytes into a CSL `FixedTransaction` (`InvalidTransaction` on failure),
   and record the raw hex for `TransactionContext.raw_hex`.
2. Collect input references as `(tx_hash_hex, index)` pairs from `tx.body().inputs()`,
   and the declared collateral references the same way from `tx.body().collateral()`.
   Both sets are resolved in one batch and split apart afterwards
   (see [section 4.4](#44-collateral-chain_extracollateral_effects)).
3. If there is anything to resolve, an RPC URL is **required** (else `InvalidMessage`). Inputs are
   resolved *not* by asking Koios for UTxO values, but by fetching the **CBOR of each
   referenced transaction** (`fetch_txs_cbor`, one request set per unique tx hash) and
   reading the referenced output out of it: `POST {rpc}/tx_cbor` with
   `{"_tx_hashes": [...]}`.
   - Requests are **chunked** at 10 hashes per call and use a blocking `reqwest`
     client with a `45s` timeout.
   - Non-2xx responses become `SignerError::RpcError`.
4. Each returned CBOR is decoded into a `FixedTransaction` and its
   `transaction_hash()` is compared against the hash it was requested under; a
   mismatch is a hard `RpcError`. A hash missing from the response is likewise an
   `RpcError`, and an input whose index is past the end of the source transaction's
   outputs is an `InvalidTransaction` (a missing input would silently understate the
   flow, so it is rejected rather than ignored).

Each resolved `Utxo` carries the input's `address`, its lovelace amount, and a list
of native assets keyed by `policy_id ‖ asset_name` (hex), all read from the source
transaction's output.

#### 4.3 Computing per-address effects

The signer builds two `address → (asset_id → amount)` maps and diffs them:

- **Inputs** map is populated from the resolved input UTxOs (value → `lovelace`,
  each native asset → `policy_id ‖ asset_name`).
- **Outputs** map is read directly from `tx.body().outputs()`: the `coin` becomes
  `lovelace`, and each `multiasset` entry becomes `policy_id_hex ‖ asset_name_hex`.
- **Withdrawals** (`tx.body().withdrawals()`) are folded into the **inputs** map:
  lovelace leaves the reward account and enters the transaction, so each
  withdrawal counts as an input from the bech32 **reward address**
  (`stake1…`) it is drawn from.
- **Certificate deposits and refunds** (`cert_deposit_or_refund`) are attributed to
  the reward address of the certificate's credential, built from that credential
  and the signer's `network_id`. A **deposit** locks lovelace under the credential
  and is therefore counted as an *output* to that reward address; a **refund**
  unlocks it and is counted as an *input*. Covered certificates are the Conway
  `reg_cert`/`unreg_cert` (only when they carry an explicit `coin` on the wire),
  stake registration-and-delegation, stake-vote registration-and-delegation, vote
  registration-and-delegation, and DRep registration/deregistration. Legacy
  Shelley certificates without an on-wire amount are skipped, because their
  deposit comes from protocol parameters that the transaction bytes do not carry.
- ADA is represented by the reserved asset id **`"lovelace"`**; every native asset
  is keyed by the concatenation of its (hex) policy id and (hex) asset name, so the
  same token nets out across inputs and outputs.

For every address touched by either side, and every asset id it involves, the
effect is `output_balance − input_balance`, computed in `i128` and rendered as a
signed decimal string (see [§4.5](#45-why-amounts-are-strings)). Zero-diff assets and
zero-diff addresses are dropped; the remaining `diff` entries are sorted by asset
id and the `effects` list is sorted by address, so the context is deterministic
(important for reproducible policy decisions and stable test vectors). A pure
self-transfer, for example, yields a single effect on the sender with only the
negative fee.

The result is returned as `TransactionContext { effects, raw_hex, data: None,
chain_extra }` and handed to the policy engine, which passes it (as part of
`PolicyContext`) to built-in rules and to executable policies over stdin.

#### 4.4 Collateral (`chain_extra.collateral_effects`)

Collateral is the one value-consuming part of a Cardano transaction that `effects`
cannot describe honestly. Every other such field — a certificate deposit, a fee, a
donation — reduces the change output, so it shows up in `effects` whether or not the
signer models the cause. Collateral does not: it is consumed through a separate path
and **only when phase-2 (script) validation fails**. Folding it into `effects` would
report a loss on the success path that never happens; leaving it out entirely would
let an executable policy that caps outflow miss it.

So it is reported separately, in the generic `chain_extra` slot:

```json
"chain_extra": {
  "collateral_effects": [
    { "address": "addr1…", "diff": [["lovelace", "-2000000"]] }
  ]
}
```

The entries have the same shape as `effects`, and the same diffing code produces
them (`effects_from_balances`): the resolved `collateral` inputs on one side,
`collateral_return` on the other, so what is reported is the **worst-case loss** if
the scripts fail. `total_collateral` is not read — it is a declared figure the ledger
already checks against the same inputs, and deriving the number from resolved UTxOs
keeps the one trust model (see [§4.2](#42-parsing-and-input-resolution-koios-tx_cbor)).

Collateral inputs are resolved in the **same** Koios batch as the spent inputs, so
exposing them usually costs no extra request — the batch is deduplicated and chunked
at ten hashes per `tx_cbor` call, so collateral adds a call only when its own unique
hashes push the total past a multiple of ten — and they are subject to the same
fail-closed rule: a collateral input Koios cannot return aborts context construction.
`chain_extra` is omitted entirely when a transaction declares no collateral, which is
every non-script transaction.

A policy that caps outflow therefore has to read both lists and decide for itself
whether to count the contingent one.

#### 4.5 Why amounts are strings

`TransactionEffect.diff` carries each amount as a signed decimal **string**, not an
integer. `TransactionEffect` lives in `ows-core` and is shared by every chain, so
the type has to hold the widest smallest-unit any chain uses: lovelace fits an
`i64` with room to spare, but wei overflows one above roughly 9.22 ETH, and a JSON
integer above 2^53 does not survive `JSON.parse` in a policy written in
JavaScript. A string has no ceiling in either place, and it matches the
`String`-typed amounts already in the context (`spending.daily_total`, and the
`value` field this replaced).

Consumers parse it themselves: `int(...)` in Python, `BigInt(...)` in JavaScript.
The subtraction that produces it runs in `i128`, so a native-asset quantity at the
top of `u64` cannot wrap on the way out.

### 5. Address balance fetching

`get_cardano_balances` (`ows/crates/ows-pay/src/cardano.rs`) queries the
configured Koios RPC URL (`ows-pay`'s `get_balances` requires an explicit RPC
URL for Cardano — a missing one is `PayErrorCode::InvalidInput`) and returns the
generic `TokenBalance` list that every other chain in `ows-pay` produces:

- ADA is reported with `address: "lovelace"`, symbol `ADA`, and 6 decimals; the
  amount is the lovelace total scaled by `10^-6`.
- Each native asset is reported with `address` set to its **asset fingerprint**
  (`asset1…`), `name` set to `policy_id.asset_name`, and `symbol`/`decimals`
  taken from the token-registry metadata — falling back to the first 10
  characters of the asset name and `0` decimals when no metadata exists.
  Zero-quantity entries are dropped, and the list is sorted by descending
  amount.
- **Koios** reads `POST {rpc}/address_info` (summing `asset_list` across the
  UTxO set) and resolves metadata via `POST {rpc}/asset_info`, chunked.

Errors are mapped onto `PayErrorCode`: transport → `HttpTransport`, non-success
status → `HttpStatus`, and an undecodable response body or amount → the new
`InvalidData`.

## Rationale

- **`cip34` namespace.** CIP-34 is the Cardano-native CAIP-2 registration and
  encodes network id + network magic deterministically, which lets a single
  identifier disambiguate mainnet/preprod/preview without inventing OWS-specific
  aliases. CIP-34 is still in _Proposed_ status, which is a known risk we accept
  and monitor.
- **Generic `ed25519-bip32` instead of `cardano-serialization-lib` for
  derivation.** The simplest route would be to derive keys with
  `cardano-serialization-lib` (CSL). OWS deliberately keeps derivation
  chain-agnostic and generic (a single `HdDeriver` across all families), so we
  implement BIP32-Ed25519 with the lightweight `ed25519-bip32` crate and only use
  CSL for Cardano-specific concerns (network parameters, address encoding, and
  transaction/witness encoding). This avoids leaking a chain-specific library into
  the generic key path while still using the canonical library for the parts that
  must match the ecosystem byte-for-byte.
- **CSL + `cardano-message-signing` for the chain plugin, per IOHK.** As recorded
  in the deliverable description (IOHK agreed on 8.4.2026 to use
  `cardano-serialization-lib`), address encoding and transaction signing go through
  CSL, and CIP-8 message signing uses Emurgo's `cardano-message-signing` COSE
  helpers rather than a hand-rolled COSE encoder. This keeps the produced
  addresses, witnesses, and signed messages compatible with mainstream Cardano
  wallets and tooling.
- **Base address with payment + stake.** Per agreement with IOHK, the initial
  implementation targets exactly one base address per account at address index 0,
  combining a payment credential (role 0) and a stake credential (role 2). This
  keeps the scope bounded while still producing a normal, stake-delegatable
  Shelley address rather than an enterprise (payment-only) address.
- **Two 96-byte keys in `KeyPair`.** Storing payment ‖ stake (192 bytes) up front
  makes the imported-key representation forward-compatible with base-address
  assembly without another schema change.
- **`default_derivation_paths` + `encode_keys` instead of widening the signer
  surface.** Rather than special-casing Cardano in every generic call site,
  overridable `ChainSigner::default_derivation_paths` and `encode_keys` let a chain
  declare how many keys per account it needs and how to pack them into one blob.
  The defaults keep single-path behavior for all other chains; only Cardano returns
  the 192-byte payment ‖ stake buffer. This localizes the "two credentials per
  account" peculiarity to the Cardano signer.
- **`address`-driven message signing.** CIP-8 embeds the signing address in the
  COSE protected headers, so `sign_message` must know which address the caller
  intends. Threading an optional `address` through the trait (rather than a
  Cardano-only API) also gave every other chain a cheap opt-in guard against
  signing with the wrong key (`verify_sign_message_address` →
  `AddressMismatch`).
- **A CBOR witness set as the signature.** `sign_transaction` returns the CBOR
  encoding of the whole `Vkeywitnesses` set, and `encode_signed_transaction`
  decodes it back with `Vkeywitnesses::from_bytes`. This keeps
  `SignOutput.signature` a flat byte string (consistent with other chains) while
  supporting the multi-witness (payment + stake) case without the caller having to
  know a fixed per-witness length.
- **Stake witnessing driven by the transaction body, not by `required_signers`.**
  A builder is not obliged to list the stake key in `required_signers`, so keying
  the decision off that field alone silently produced unsubmittable delegation and
  withdrawal transactions. `sign_transaction` therefore derives the required stake
  key hashes from the certificates and withdrawals themselves (mirroring the
  ledger's `witsVKeyNeeded`) and keeps `required_signers` only as an additional
  trigger — never as the reason to declare a stake key missing, since a hash listed
  there frequently belongs to a co-signer. When a stake signature is structurally
  required and no stake key is available, failing early is preferable to handing
  back a transaction that dies in phase-1 validation.
- **`COSE_Key` as the message-signing public key.** CIP-30's `signData` returns a
  `(signature, key)` pair where `key` is a COSE key, not raw bytes. Returning the
  serialized `COSE_Key` in `SignOutput.public_key` lets wallet/dApp verifiers use
  the output as-is instead of re-wrapping the raw Ed25519 key themselves.
- **Deposits, refunds, and withdrawals attributed to the reward address.** Staking
  lovelace is locked under a *credential*, not at a payment address, so the only
  faithful place to book it is the credential's reward address. Treating deposits
  as outputs and refunds/withdrawals as inputs keeps the netting arithmetic
  identical to the UTxO side, so a policy sees "2 ADA left this payment address and
  2 ADA is now locked at this `stake1…`" instead of an unexplained outflow.
- **RPC-resolved transaction effects for policy.** Cardano inputs carry no value,
  so a meaningful `TransactionContext` cannot be built from the transaction bytes
  alone. Rather than inventing a Cardano-only policy path, the existing
  `make_transaction_context` hook is overridden to resolve inputs via Koios and emit
  the same chain-agnostic `TransactionEffect` shape every other chain uses — so
  executable policies see uniform per-address asset deltas regardless of chain. The
  RPC dependency is threaded only for Cardano; all other chains keep passing `None`.
- **Reject missing input UTxOs.** If Koios omits a referenced transaction, returns
  CBOR whose hash does not match, or the referenced output index does not exist,
  `make_transaction_context` errors instead of proceeding. An unresolved input would
  silently understate the ADA/asset outflow and could let a spending policy pass a
  transaction it should have denied, so a partial resolution is treated as a hard
  failure.

- **Deterministic effect ordering.** Effects are sorted by address and each `diff`
  by asset id, and ADA is normalized to the single `"lovelace"` key. This makes the
  context stable across runs, so policy decisions are reproducible and reference
  vectors are exact.
- **Collateral is contingent, and reported as such.** Collateral is consumed only on
  phase-2 validation failure, so it is reported under
  `chain_extra.collateral_effects` rather than folded into `effects`, which would
  overstate every script transaction's cost on the success path
  (see [section 4.4](#44-collateral-chain_extracollateral_effects)). The consequence
  for policy authors is explicit: a spend cap that reads only `effects` does not
  bound the collateral at risk, because collateral does not reduce the change
  output. Declarative rules read neither list, so capping spend needs an executable
  policy, and that policy has to add the two together itself.

### Acceptance Criteria

These deliverables are considered complete when:

1. `ChainType::Cardano` exists and round-trips through serde, `namespace()`,
   `from_namespace()`, `default_coin_type()`, and `Display`/`FromStr`.
2. `parse_chain` resolves `cardano`, `cardano-preprod`, `cardano-preview`, and the
   corresponding `cip34:*` ids; `default_chain_for_type(Cardano)` is mainnet.
3. Default Koios RPC endpoints are registered for all three networks and resolved
   by the generic RPC lookup.
4. `Curve::Ed25519Bip32` reports correct key lengths (96 / 32).
5. `HdDeriver` produces the correct Icarus master `XPrv` from entropy (matches
   published vectors) and performs V2 child derivation, including the CIP-1852
   payment/stake/account paths.
6. `CardanoSigner` reports curve `Ed25519Bip32`, coin type `1815`, and the
   CIP-1852 payment leaf as its default path.
7. Multi-curve key storage carries an `ed25519_bip32` entry (192 bytes for
   imported keys) without changing the wallet schema version, and an explicitly
   supplied key is accepted only in the 96/192-byte shapes with valid
   Ed25519-BIP32 clamping.
8. `derive_address` produces the correct mainnet Shelley **base** address from
   192-byte key material and the correct **enterprise** address from 96-byte
   payment-only material (verified against fixed vectors for 12- and 24-word
   mnemonics).
9. `sign_message` produces a CIP-8 `COSE_Sign1` matching reference vectors for the
   no-address, base, enterprise, and reward-address cases, returns the signing
   key as a serialized `COSE_Key`, and rejects an address the key does not control
   with `AddressMismatch`.
10. `sign_transaction` produces correct `Vkeywitness`(es) — payment only, and
    payment + stake when the transaction's certificates, withdrawals, or
    `required_signers` demand it — and `encode_signed_transaction` round-trips the
    witness set into a submittable transaction matching reference CBOR vectors.
11. `default_derivation_paths` returns both CIP-1852 paths for Cardano, and
    `encode_keys` returns the 192-byte payment ‖ stake buffer; all other chains
    remain on their single-path defaults.
12. `make_transaction_context` parses an unsigned Cardano transaction, resolves its
    inputs via Koios `tx_cbor`, and produces per-address `TransactionEffect`s with
    correct signed ADA and native-asset diffs (verified against mocked Koios
    responses for self-transfer, external+change, asset-carrying, and
    multi-input/multi-output cases); withdrawals and certificate deposits/refunds
    are booked against the corresponding reward address; declared collateral is
    resolved in the same batch and reported under `chain_extra.collateral_effects`,
    net of `collateral_return`, and is absent for a transaction without collateral;
    it errors when the RPC URL is missing for a transaction with inputs, or when
    Koios returns incomplete transaction data.
13. Address balance fetching returns ADA under `lovelace` plus one entry per
    native asset (fingerprint, `policy_id.asset_name`, token-registry
    symbol/decimals), and an amount that cannot be decoded
    fails with `PayErrorCode::InvalidData` instead of reporting `0`.

### Implementation Plan

Everything specified above is landed and covered by unit/integration tests (see
[Testing](#testing)): the chain-registry/addressing layer, Ed25519-BIP32 key
derivation, the chain plugin interface (Shelley base/enterprise/reward address
encoding, raw signing, CIP-8 message signing, and transaction signing/witness
encoding), policy-engine support (`make_transaction_context` with Koios input
resolution), address balance fetching, and the CLI/binding surface for the
optional `address` argument. Remaining Cardano work (separate deliverables)
proceeds as: transaction *building* (input selection, fee/change), persisting
both payment and stake paths per `WalletAccount`, and optional alternative RPC
providers (e.g. Blockfrost).

## Backwards Compatibility Assessment

- **Wallet file schema unchanged.** `ows_version` stays at `2`. The new
  `ed25519_bip32` key field is additive; existing mnemonic wallets need no
  migration (Cardano keys are derived on demand). Private-key wallets imported
  before Cardano support simply have no `ed25519_bip32` material and surface a
  clear error if used for Cardano, rather than silently degrading.
- **Existing families untouched.** secp256k1 and SLIP-10 ed25519 derivation paths
  are unchanged; the `Ed25519Bip32` branch is additive in `Curve`, `HdDeriver`,
  and `KeyPair`. Characterization tests on EVM/Solana derivation continue to pass.
- **`sign_message` signature changed (binding-level).** Adding `address:
  Option<&str>` to `ChainSigner::sign_message` and to the `ows-lib`/binding entry
  points is a source-breaking change for direct callers, mitigated by making the
  parameter optional: passing `None` reproduces the prior behavior exactly, and
  every chain's non-Cardano message signing is unchanged when no address is given.
  `default_derivation_paths` and `encode_keys` are purely additive (defaults mirror
  the old inline single-path derivation).
- **Policy context is additive.** `make_transaction_context` already existed on
  `ChainSigner` with a default-empty implementation; Cardano overrides it and the new
  `SignerError::RpcError` variant is additive, so no other chain's behavior changes.
  The lib call sites resolve an RPC URL only for Cardano (all other chains keep
  passing `None`), so no new network call is introduced for existing chains.
- **New network dependency for Cardano signing requests.** Building a Cardano
  policy context now performs a Koios call when the transaction has inputs; a Cardano
  signing request that previously would have proceeded with empty effects now
  requires provider reachability (and errors if none is configured/available). This
  is intended — the policy engine needs the flow to make a decision — but it is a
  behavioral change for Cardano relative to the prior default-empty context.
- **Known abstraction gap.** `WalletAccount` still stores a single
  `derivation_path`, so the stored Cardano account currently records only the
  payment leaf even though the signer now derives both payment and stake keys at
  runtime via `default_derivation_paths` and `encode_keys`. Persisting both paths
  per account is a noted
  follow-up (`TODO` in `derive_all_accounts`).

## Security Considerations

- **Key material handling.** All derived keys are wrapped in `SecretBytes`
  (zeroized on drop). Intermediate buffers in HD derivation are explicitly
  zeroized. The 96-byte extended private keys are treated as secrets identical to
  other curve keys. Every buffer that transiently holds an Ed25519-BIP32 secret is
  covered: the PBKDF2 output and normalized master `XPrv`
  (`ed25519_bip32_master_xprv_from_entropy`), the randomly generated import keys,
  the decoded hex of an explicitly supplied key, the `KeyPair` fields and the JSON
  blob they are serialized into, and the bit accumulator and phrase copy inside
  `Mnemonic::entropy()` — all are `Zeroizing`/explicitly wiped rather than left to
  the allocator. The Cardano signer also keeps the secret out of CSL entirely: it
  holds an `ed25519-bip32` `XPrv`, which zeroizes in its own `Drop` and signs out of
  that buffer, because CSL's `PrivateKey` would copy the extended secret into an
  allocation nothing wipes (see the `clear_on_drop` note under *Unmaintained
  transitive dependencies* below). What the `XPrv` does not wipe is the stack: the
  copies `from_slice_verified` makes on the way in, and the moved-from slot left
  when an `XPrv` is returned by value, run no `Drop`. Wiping those would take a
  by-reference constructor `ed25519-bip32` does not offer.
- **Never format an `XPrv`.** Unlike CSL's key types — `Bip32PrivateKey` has no
  `Debug`, and `chain_crypto::SecretKey`'s is `#[cfg(test)]`-gated — `XPrv`
  implements both `Debug` and `Display` unconditionally, and both `hex::encode` the
  full 96 bytes into a `String` nothing zeroizes. No code formats one today; a
  `{:?}` added to a log line or an error message later is all it would take, so
  treat the two impls as unusable.
- **Malformed imported keys are rejected.** A user-supplied `ed25519_bip32` key is
  shape- and clamping-checked at import (see
  [§2.6](#26-multi-credential-key-storage)), so an unusable key surfaces at import
  time rather than as an opaque failure on first use.
- **Icarus master key.** Uses PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 (4096 iterations, entropy as
  salt) with an empty password, and `normalize_bytes_force3rd`. CIP-3 permits a
  non-empty password and publishes a vector for one; OWS has no BIP-39 passphrase
  to supply, so it uses the empty form — the one the published vector in the tests
  pins, and the one a wallet holding only the mnemonic can reproduce. Any other
  password, or deriving from the BIP-39 seed instead of the entropy, yields a
  different root key and a different set of addresses, so it would have to be an
  explicit and visible choice rather than a silent one.
- **Non-hardened derivation.** BIP32-Ed25519 V2 permits non-hardened child keys.
  This is required for Cardano interoperability, but callers should remain aware
  that a non-hardened branch's xpub + a single child xprv can expose sibling keys;
  the default account/payment/stake paths use hardened account-level segments.
  Path components at or above 2³¹ are rejected on every curve, so a bare
  `m/2147483648` cannot be used as an alias for the hardened `m/0'` (see
  [§2.3](#23-child-derivation)) — two spellings of one path would otherwise let the
  same key be reached under a path a policy or an account record does not
  recognize.
- **Key cache isolation.** The derivation cache key includes the curve tag, so
  Ed25519-BIP32 keys cannot be confused with secp256k1/ed25519 keys derived at the
  same BIP path string.
- **Keyless RPC.** Koios needs no API key, avoiding credential storage. Broadcast
  is performed over HTTPS; transaction submission and input resolution will rely on
  this provider, so provider availability/trust is a deployment consideration.
- **Address-bound message signing.** `sign_message` always re-derives the address
  from the supplied key material and refuses to sign for an `address` the key does
  not control (`AddressMismatch`). The signing address is embedded in the CIP-8
  COSE protected headers, so a verifier can confirm which credential signed. Across
  other chains the same `verify_sign_message_address` guard prevents signing a
  message under an address the wallet did not derive.
- **Selective stake witnessing.** `sign_transaction` only attaches a stake witness
  when the transaction body actually calls for one — a certificate stake
  credential, a pool-owner hash, a withdrawal reward account, or an explicit
  `required_signers` entry matching the stake key hash — so a routine payment
  transaction is never signed with the stake key. Conversely, when the body
  structurally requires a stake signature the wallet cannot provide, signing fails
  instead of emitting a transaction that would be rejected on submission.
  Transaction *content* is not otherwise inspected or policy-checked here —
  the signer trusts the caller-provided unsigned CBOR — so transaction building and
  vetting remain the responsibility of upstream layers.
- **Trust in the RPC-derived context.** Cardano input values come from Koios, so the
  `TransactionContext` a policy evaluates is only as trustworthy as the RPC
  provider. Fetching whole source transactions rather than endpoint-computed UTxO
  values narrows that trust: each returned CBOR is re-hashed and must match the hash
  it was requested under, so the endpoint cannot fabricate input values under a tx
  hash the transaction actually references (it can still withhold a transaction,
  which fails closed). The keyless Koios default trades authentication for
  operational simplicity; deployments with stronger requirements should point RPC
  config at a trusted provider. To limit silent under-reporting, a transaction with
  inputs and no RPC URL is rejected, and any input Koios fails to return aborts
  context construction rather than degrading to a partial view. On the balance path
  the same strictness applies: an unparseable lovelace balance or asset quantity is
  a hard `PayErrorCode::InvalidData` error rather than a silent `0`, so a
  malformed response cannot understate holdings. Nullable Koios fields
  (`asset_list`, `asset_name`, token-registry `decimals`) are modelled as optional
  and default to empty/`0`, because their absence is a normal response shape rather
  than corrupt data.
- **What the RPC provider learns.** Building the policy context is the first thing in
  OWS that makes a network call from `ows-signer`, so it is worth being exact about
  what leaves the machine. **The transaction being signed is never sent.**
  `make_transaction_context` asks Koios for the CBOR of transactions that are
  *already on chain*, by hash — the hashes the unsigned transaction's inputs and
  collateral reference (`POST {rpc}/tx_cbor`). Signing itself is local; no key
  material, and no part of the transaction under construction, is transmitted.
  What the provider (and anything on the network path) can observe is the set of
  source transaction hashes and the requester's IP, from which it can infer which
  UTxOs the wallet is about to spend and correlate requests over time. Broadcast is
  the separate step that does transmit the finished transaction
  (`POST {rpc}/submittx`), as any submission path must. A deployment that treats
  that inference as sensitive should point `rpc` config at a provider it operates
  (see [§1.4](#14-rpc-configuration-koios-keyless)); the keyless Koios default
  trades this for needing no account and storing no credential.
- **Unmaintained transitive dependencies.** The two Emurgo crates bring in five
  crates carrying RUSTSEC *unmaintained* advisories. Four come from
  `cardano-serialization-lib`: `clear_on_drop`, and `rand_os` with `cloudabi` and
  `fuchsia-cprng` under it. The fifth, `nodrop`, comes from
  `emurgo-cardano-message-signing` instead, four levels down
  (`pruefung` → `digest 0.6` → `generic-array 0.8` → `nodrop`); CSL does not depend
  on `generic-array` at all. These are warn-level "no longer maintained" notices,
  not known vulnerabilities, and OWS accepts them knowingly rather than silently,
  since CSL is the only maintained Rust implementation of Cardano's wire formats.
  None of the five is reachable from OWS:
  - `rand_os`, and `cloudabi`/`fuchsia-cprng` under it, back CSL's *key generation*
    (`Bip32PrivateKey::generate_ed25519_bip32`, `PrivateKey::generate_*`), which OWS
    never calls — the signer constructs no CSL private key at all, and every
    OWS key comes from `ed25519-bip32` and `rand` in `ows-signer` (see
    [§2.2](#22-master-key-generation-icarus)). `cloudabi` and `fuchsia-cprng` are in
    the lockfile but do not build on any target OWS ships: they are `rand_os`'s
    per-OS backends for CloudABI and Fuchsia.
  - `clear_on_drop` is declared by CSL but never referenced anywhere in its source,
    so it is compiled and never runs. The consequence is worth stating plainly, since
    it is the opposite of what the dependency name suggests: CSL zeroizes none of its
    own key types. `Bip32PrivateKey` escapes the consequence only because the `XPrv`
    it wraps wipes itself (`ed25519-bip32`'s `Drop` calls `securemem::zero`), but
    `PrivateKey` — what `Bip32PrivateKey::to_raw_key` returns, and what CSL's signing
    helpers take — holds an `ExtendedPriv([u8; 64])` with no `Drop` at all. Signing
    through CSL would therefore leave a copy of the 64-byte extended secret in freed
    memory on every call. Key *hashing* never had this problem: it goes through
    `Bip32PublicKey::to_raw_key`, which yields a `PublicKey` and touches no secret.
    OWS never constructs a CSL private key: `decode_keys` keeps the secret in an
    `XPrv`, `XPrv::sign` signs out of that buffer, and only the 32-byte public key is
    handed to CSL (see
    [§3](#3-transaction-and-message-signing-chain-plugin-interface)). The
    `SecretBytes`/`Zeroizing` buffer it decodes from is wiped on drop (see
    [§2.6](#26-multi-credential-key-storage)).
  - `nodrop` is a pre-1.0 `ManuallyDrop` polyfill under `generic-array 0.8`, which
    `pruefung` needs for the FNV-32a checksum in `emurgo-cardano-message-signing`.
    That checksum only serves `SignedMessage::{to,from}_user_facing_encoding` (the
    `cms_…` string format); OWS signs through `COSESign1Builder` and never calls
    either, so the code path is not reached.

  The revisit trigger is a CSL or message-signing release that drops them, or a
  maintained fork; that would be a dependency bump with no change to OWS code.

## Implementation

Components modified or added:

- `ows/crates/ows-core/src/chain.rs` — `ChainType::Cardano`; `cip34` namespace mapping;
  coin type `1815`; mainnet/preprod/preview registry entries;
  `UNIVERSAL_WALLET_EXTRA_CHAIN_NAMES`; `parse_chain` support.
- `ows/crates/ows-core/src/config.rs` — default Koios RPC endpoints for the three networks.
- `ows/crates/ows-core/src/wallet_file.rs` — `KeyType::PrivateKey` doc updated to include
  `ed25519_bip32`.
- `ows/crates/ows-signer/src/curve.rs` — `Curve::Ed25519Bip32` and key lengths.
- `ows/crates/ows-signer/src/mnemonic.rs` — `Mnemonic::entropy()` (raw BIP-39 entropy).
- `ows/crates/ows-signer/src/hd.rs` — Icarus master-key generation and V2 child derivation;
  a single shared path parser (`parse_path_components`) that bounds every index
  below 2³¹.
- `ows/crates/ows-signer/src/chains/cardano.rs` — `CardanoSigner`, CIP-1852 path helpers,
  network selection, and the full `ChainSigner` impl: base/enterprise/reward
  address encoding, `sign`, CIP-8 `sign_message`, `sign_transaction`,
  `encode_signed_transaction`, the `default_derivation_paths` / `encode_keys`
  overrides, and the `make_transaction_context` override plus its Koios `tx_cbor`
  client (`fetch_txs_cbor`), which also books withdrawals and certificate
  deposits/refunds against the reward address and reports declared collateral under
  `chain_extra.collateral_effects`.
- `ows/crates/ows-signer/src/traits.rs` — `sign_message` gains `address: Option<&str>`; new
  default methods `verify_sign_message_address`, `transaction_context_needs_rpc`,
  `default_derivation_paths`, and
  `encode_keys`; new `SignerError::AddressMismatch` and `SignerError::RpcError`.
  (`make_transaction_context` already existed as a default-empty hook; Cardano now
  overrides it.)
- `ows/crates/ows-lib/src/ops.rs` & `ows/crates/ows-lib/src/key_ops.rs` — `sign_and_send` and
  `sign_with_api_key` resolve the Koios RPC URL for Cardano and pass it into
  `make_transaction_context`; `resolve_rpc_url` is exposed for reuse.
- `ows/crates/ows-pay/src/cardano.rs` & `ows/crates/ows-pay/src/error.rs` — address balance fetching via
  Koios `address_info` / `asset_info`; new `PayErrorCode::InvalidData` for a
  response whose amounts cannot be decoded.
- `ows/crates/ows-signer/src/chains/*.rs` — every chain's `sign_message` updated to the new
  signature and calls `verify_sign_message_address`.
- `ows/crates/ows-signer/src/chains/mod.rs` & `lib.rs` — register `CardanoSigner` in
  `signer_for_chain`; integration test uses `default_derivation_paths` and
  `encode_keys`.
- `ows/crates/ows-lib/src/ops.rs` — `KeyPair.ed25519_bip32`, random 192-byte generation,
  `validate_ed25519_bip32_key` on private-key import,
  curve dispatch, `broadcast_cardano`; `sign_message`/`sign_typed_data` thread the
  `address` argument; mnemonic derivation routes through `default_derivation_paths`
  and `encode_keys`.
- `ows/crates/ows-lib/src/key_ops.rs` — API-key `sign_message`/`sign_typed_data` thread
  `address` and call `verify_sign_message_address`.
- `ows/crates/ows-cli` — `sign message --address` flag; `derive` uses
  `default_derivation_paths` and `encode_keys`.
- `bindings/node` & `bindings/python` — `sign_message`/`sign_typed_data` expose
  the optional `address` argument.

Dependencies added:

- `ed25519-bip32 = "0.4.1"` — generic BIP32-Ed25519 derivation
  (`ows/crates/ows-signer/Cargo.toml`, `ows/crates/ows-lib/Cargo.toml`).
- `pbkdf2 = "0.12"` — Icarus master-key derivation
  (`ows/crates/ows-signer/Cargo.toml`).
- `cardano-serialization-lib = "14.1.1"` (lockfile resolves 14.1.2) — Cardano
  network parameters (`NetworkInfo`), Shelley address encoding, and
  transaction/witness encoding (`ows/crates/ows-signer/Cargo.toml`).
- `emurgo-cardano-message-signing = "1.1.0"` — CIP-8 COSE message-signing helpers
  (`ows/crates/ows-signer/Cargo.toml`).
- `reqwest = "0.12"` (blocking, `json`, `rustls-tls`, no default features) — Koios
  `tx_cbor` HTTP client used to resolve transaction inputs for the policy context
  (`ows/crates/ows-signer/Cargo.toml`). This is the first network dependency in
  `ows-signer`, the crate that holds key material; what it does and does not send is
  spelled out under "What the RPC provider learns" in Security considerations.
- `mockito = "1"` (dev-dependency) — mocks the Koios endpoints in the
  `make_transaction_context` and balance tests
  (`ows/crates/ows-signer/Cargo.toml`, `ows/crates/ows-pay/Cargo.toml`).

## Testing

Implemented and passing for these deliverables:

- **Curve** (`curve.rs`): key-length and equality tests for `Ed25519Bip32`.
- **Master key / derivation** (`hd.rs`): Icarus master `XPrv` vectors (named and
  all-zero "abandon" mnemonic); V2 hardened child derivation against
  `ed25519-bip32` crate vectors; rejection of a 64-byte BIP-39 seed for the
  Ed25519-BIP32 curve; equivalence of mnemonic-based vs master-`XPrv`-based
  derivation for `m/1852'/1815'/0'/0/0`.
- **Path validation** (`hd.rs`): indices at or above 2³¹ are rejected by
  `validate_path` and by `derive` on all three curves, while `2147483647`(`'`) is
  still accepted; repeated hardened markers (`m/44''`) are rejected; and
  `m/2147483648` no longer aliases `m/0'` on the Ed25519-BIP32 curve.
- **Mnemonic** (`mnemonic.rs`): `entropy()` returns all-zero entropy for the
  "abandon" vector, and matches the Trezor BIP-39 vectors for 12- and 24-word
  phrases (the 24-word cases pin the checksum-byte truncation, since 24 words
  carry 264 bits).
- **Chain registry** (`chain.rs`): serde round-trip including Cardano; namespace,
  coin type, and `from_namespace("cip34")` mappings; `parse_chain` for friendly
  names and `cip34:*` ids; universal-wallet order/count (mainnet + preprod +
  preview).
- **Config** (`config.rs`): default RPC lookups for all three Koios endpoints.
- **Signer** (`cardano.rs`): CIP-1852 path construction; chain type/curve/coin
  type; default path equals payment leaf; `from_chain_id` maps the three known
  references to their network ids and rejects every other one, with
  `signer_for_chain` propagating that rejection for a `cip34:` id `parse_chain`
  accepted.
- **Address encoding** (`cardano.rs`): mainnet **base** address from 12- and
  24-word mnemonics (via `default_derivation_paths` and `encode_keys`) against fixed
  `addr1q…` vectors;
  **enterprise** address from a payment-only key against fixed `addr1v…` vectors.
- **Message signing** (`cardano.rs`): CIP-8 `COSE_Sign1` output against reference
  vectors for the no-address, base, enterprise, and reward-address cases
  (including the expected serialized `COSE_Key` per signing credential).
- **Transaction signing** (`cardano.rs`): a CBOR test-transaction builder takes a
  body-customization closure and exercises the payment-only witness path, the
  payment + `required_signers` stake path, a stake-delegation certificate, and a
  withdrawal; `sign_transaction` signatures and the `encode_signed_transaction`
  output are asserted against reference CBOR, and the certificate/withdrawal cases
  assert that the witness set carries exactly the payment and stake public keys.
- **Key import** (`ows/crates/ows-lib/src/ops.rs`): a private-key wallet imports both the
  96-byte payment and the 192-byte payment ‖ stake Ed25519-BIP32 shapes and
  exports them unchanged; a 64-byte key and a 96-byte key with invalid scalar
  clamping are both rejected at import.
- **Cross-chain `sign_message`** (`evm.rs`, etc.): `AddressMismatch` is returned
  for a wrong `address`, and signing succeeds when the derived address is passed;
  `None` reproduces prior signatures (`solana.rs`, `bitcoin.rs`).
- **Integration** (`lib.rs`): `signer_for_chain` derives a mainnet `addr1…` base
  address via `default_derivation_paths`, `encode_keys`, and `derive_address`, now
  passing end-to-end.
- **Policy context** (`cardano.rs`): `make_transaction_context` is exercised with a
  mocked Koios `tx_cbor` endpoint (`mockito`, serving real CBOR for the source
  transactions) across the flow shapes that matter
  for policy evaluation — a self-transfer (only the negative fee shows up), a single
  input with an external payment plus change, the same with a native asset split
  between external and change outputs, and multi-input/multi-output transactions
  that rebalance across the wallet's own addresses and to a third party. Three
  collateral shapes are covered too: collateral with no `collateral_return` (the
  whole collateral input is at risk, and none of it appears in `effects`), collateral
  with a partial return (only the remainder is at risk), and a transaction with no
  collateral at all (`chain_extra` is absent). Three
  staking shapes are covered on top of those: a **withdrawal** (reward address
  debited, payment address credited with the withdrawal minus the fee), a **stake
  registration deposit** (payment address debited by deposit + fee, reward address
  credited with the locked deposit), and a **stake deregistration refund** (the
  mirror image). Each asserts
  the exact sorted `effects` (per-address signed lovelace and asset diffs) and that
  the mock endpoint was hit. Balance fetching (`ows-pay/src/cardano.rs`) is covered
  by tests against mocked Koios `address_info` / `asset_info` endpoints.
