# `ows sign tx --chain midnight:*` — the DApp-connector pipeline

**Milestones:** Midnight 2 (PR #15, the pipeline + four connector methods) and
Midnight 3 (PR #18, the effect-aware second policy pass).
**Purpose:** turn a DApp Connector request into a fully proven, signed, **sealed**
transaction — without broadcasting it.

```sh
OWS_PASSPHRASE= ows sign tx --chain midnight:preview --wallet length-wallet --json --tx '{
  "method": "makeTransfer",
  "desiredOutputs": [
    { "kind": "unshielded", "type": "night", "value": "1000000", "recipient": "<mn_addr…>" }
  ],
  "options": { "payFees": true }
}'
# → { "recovery_id": …, "signature": "…", "transaction": "0x…sealed hex" }
```

On every other chain, `sign tx` accepts hex-encoded unsigned transaction bytes and returns
a signature. On Midnight the wallet **is** the DApp Connector: the `--tx` argument is a
JSON connector request describing *what the user wants*, and the wallet constructs,
balances, proves, signs, and seals a complete transaction. `sign tx` seals it and returns
the sealed hex on `SignResult.transaction`; it does **not** broadcast. (Broadcasting is
[`sign send-tx`](./sign-send-tx.md).)

## Why `--tx` is JSON, not hex

`decode_tx_input` (`ows-lib/src/ops.rs`) hex-decodes for every chain **except** Midnight,
where it carries the argument through unchanged as UTF-8 bytes. This is because a Midnight
connector request is a JSON document, not a wire transaction, and it must be parsed by the
*key-aware* step (the wallet's own inputs are needed to balance it). Decoding needs no key,
so it can run before policy evaluation on the agent path.

## The pipeline

```
decode_tx_input            carry the JSON request through (no key)
        │
prepare_signable_tx        the key-aware step (ows-lib):
        │   ├─ build ONE MidnightCryptoProvider from the credential (ows-lib holds the key)
        │   ├─ plan_connector_tx  → an inert ConnectorPlan (no proofs, no signatures)
        │   ├─ plan.effects(…)    → the wallet-relative net movement
        │   ├─ ── POLICY SEAM ──  gate(effects)   ← second, effect-aware policy pass
        │   └─ plan.authorize(…)  → build + prove + sign the binding + serialize
        │
sign / seal                extract signable bytes, sign, encode_signed_transaction (seal)
        │
SignResult.transaction     the sealed, submit-ready tx hex (NOT broadcast)
```

The key design point is that **the plan is inert** — `ConnectorPlan` carries no bearer
instrument (no proofs, no signatures). That lets the wallet derive the transaction's
*effects* and run a policy check on them **before** any expensive proving happens. If the
policy denies, the key is dropped unused and nothing is ever proved.

`ows-lib` is the only layer that touches the decrypted key: it builds the
`MidnightCryptoProvider` once and hands only `&provider` into `ows-midnight`.

## Owner mode vs agent (token) mode

`sign tx` reads `OWS_PASSPHRASE`:

- **Owner passphrase** → decrypt the key directly, full authority. `prepare_signable_tx`
  is called with a gate that always allows — no policy at all.
- **API token** (`ows_key_…`) → two policy passes:
  1. **First pass** (`enforce_policies_and_decrypt_key`) — before the key is released,
     the request's *shape* is gated. `make_transaction_context` surfaces the raw request;
     `effects` is empty here because nothing has been planned yet. Declarative rules
     (allowed chains, allowed methods, …) fire here.
  2. **Second pass** (the policy seam, `enforce_effect_policies`) — after planning, the
     plan's key-derived, wallet-relative **effects** are filled in and the key's
     **executable** policies are re-evaluated. This is the Midnight-3 addition.

Both `sign tx` and `sign send-tx` run this same two-pass connector pipeline on the agent
path — `sign_and_send` routes Midnight through `decode_tx_input` + `prepare_signable_tx`
exactly as `sign tx` does. The only difference is the tail: `sign tx` seals and returns
the hex; `sign send-tx` also broadcasts. So a policy denial at either pass blocks a
broadcast too — the transaction is never proved, let alone submitted.

## The four connector methods

`plan_connector_tx` routes on the request's top-level `method`. An **absent** `method`
resolves to `balanceUnsealedTransaction`, the wallet's original (pre-multi-method)
behavior. Each method has its own submodule under `ows-midnight/src/dapp_connector/`.

### `makeTransfer`

*"Send these outputs."* The wallet builds an outputs-only transaction (a deliberate
deficit), then balances it with its **own** inputs, proves, signs, and seals. Fees are
paid in **dust**, never in the transferred token.

- Unshielded outputs ride the guaranteed offer of an intent keyed at a **non-zero intent
  id** — id 0 names the guaranteed segment, which is built across every intent rather than
  belonging to one, so the ledger rejects an intent declared there (surfaced on-chain as
  `Custom error: 167`). The outputs still execute unconditionally, in segment 0 with every
  other intent's guaranteed half; only the *intent's id* is non-zero.
- Shielded outputs ride the guaranteed Zswap offer directly.
- The outputs-only proven transaction reuses the same `plan_unsealed_proven_tx →
  authorize_proven_tx` tail as `balanceUnsealed` — one "diagonal" that every method funnels
  into.

### `makeIntent`

*"Build a maker swap offer."* The wallet contributes real inputs and declares wanted
outputs, producing a deliberately **imbalanced** maker offer (a swap intent). `sign tx`
seals it as a fully-sealed offer (`proof,pedersen-schnorr`) for hand-off to a taker.
Shielded *inputs* to a maker offer are supported — the wallet selects whole shielded coins,
returns the excess as change to the maker, and the spend witnesses are built and proved in
the signer.

**`options.intentId`** — the id the maker's intent keys at, per the spec: a number, or
`"random"` to let the wallet draw one (its suggested mode for swaps; a wide draw is what keeps
two independently-built intents from colliding when the taker merges its own in). Omitted, it
is `1`. Id `0` is rejected — it names the guaranteed segment, which spans all intents rather
than being any one intent's, so the ledger rejects an intent declared there (`Custom error:
167`) — as is anything past the 16-bit id space. The id doubles as the segment id of this
intent's fallible half, which is what a policy reading effects sees.

**`options.payFees`** — `true` is **rejected** here, with an error saying so. A maker offer is
imbalanced and fee-free by construction: the taker funds the DUST fee when it completes the
swap. The spec's blanket default for `payFees` is `true`, but its own reference SDK defaults
`initSwap` to `false`, and an error is the honest answer to a request this wallet cannot
satisfy — better than returning an offer that quietly does the opposite. Omitted or `false`
builds the fee-free offer. (The other three methods do honor `payFees` in both directions.)

**`options.ttl` — when the offer expires.** Optional; Unix epoch seconds. Omitted, the wallet
picks the widest window the ledger accepts (`global_ttl` past now — currently an hour, and the
reference wallet SDK's default too), which is what every offer got before this option existed.

The expiry matters more here than on the other methods. `Intent.ttl` is inside the seal cover
and `makeIntent` runs no balancing tail, so **nothing downstream can change it** — not the
taker, not a service relaying the offer. It is also the maker's only unilateral way out: a
sealed offer is a bearer artifact, cancellable only by letting it expire or by double-spending
one of its inputs. A maker quoting a price it re-quotes often is therefore writing a free option
against itself for the whole window, and wants a short one:

```sh
# this quote stands for 30 seconds
"options": { "ttl": 1785878998 }
```

The request is rejected at parse — before any proving is paid for — if the instant is not in the
future (born expired) or is further than `global_ttl` ahead, the two bounds the ledger enforces
against the block the offer lands in (`IntentTtlExpired`, `IntentTtlTooFarInFuture`).

A taker should read the maker's TTL before completing an offer: the merged transaction has to
land inside it, and the taker's own tip-aligned TTL does not extend it — the ledger checks each
intent's TTL separately.

> method and leaves the choice to the wallet. It is an OWS extension, kept optional precisely so

> spec to adopt.

### `balanceSealedTransaction`

*"Complete a maker's offer as the taker."* The wallet funds the maker's imbalance with its
own inputs, balances, signs, and seals. The accepted maker format matters:

- A **proven** maker (`proof,embedded-fr`) is the happy path — the taker funds the
  imbalance with its own inputs, balances, signs, and seals.
- A **fully-sealed** maker (`proof,pedersen-schnorr`) cannot be balanced in place (its
  binding fixes the value balance), so the taker completes it by **MERGING**: it builds the
  per-token complement of the maker's imbalance, funds the merged tx's DUST fee, seals its
  half, and `Transaction::merge`s the two.
- A bare `zswapoffer` bech32 (MIP-0005) or a MIP-0006 offer JSON is accepted too — wrapped
  or materialized into a proven maker, then balanced.

### `balanceUnsealedTransaction`

*"Balance this proven, unsealed transaction against my inputs."* The dApp hands the wallet
an already-**proven** (`proof,embedded-fr`) transaction; the wallet balances it, signs, and
seals. This is the original method (and the default when `method` is absent).

- A `proof-preimage` transaction is **rejected** with a precise "out-of-spec, not
  unsupported" message — the dApp must prove its own part first.

> The only **rejected-by-design** input is a `proof-preimage` maker (above) — out of spec,
> not unsupported. `makeIntent` shielded inputs, the sealed-maker merge, and the MIP-0005 /
> MIP-0006 offer forms are all supported (added in [Midnight 2.5]).

## Fees are always dust

Every method pays fees in **dust**, sized against the node's real fee gate. Two fee modes
exist depending on the wallet's NIGHT registration state:

- **Generationless DUST** — when the wallet has *unregistered* NIGHT inputs, a dust
  registration is derived from them on the fly.
- **DUST spend proofs** — when all NIGHT is already registered, existing dust is spent with
  proofs.

Fee sizing is done by mock-proving the shielded/dust fragments offline (through the crypto
provider's `build_preimage_dust_spends`) so the fee is right before the real proof is
built. The best-Dust NIGHT coin is reserved for the fee registration, and leftover NIGHT is
rotated through a fallible offer so change returns cleanly.

## The effect model (what the policy seam gates on)

`ConnectorPlan::segment_effects` computes the transaction's **wallet-relative net
movement**, grouped by the **segment** each piece executes in — not by the intent that
carried it. Segment `0` is the guaranteed one (applied unconditionally once the tx lands,
pooling the guaranteed halves of every intent); a non-zero segment is one intent's fallible
half, which may revert on its own, and its id is that intent's id. Within a segment it is one
`TransactionEffect` per value domain that nets non-zero, keyed by the wallet's own address for
that domain. (Intent versus segment is spelled out in
[README.md](./README.md#intents-and-segments-are-not-the-same-thing).) How it is derived depends
on the method:

- **`balanceUnsealed` / `balanceSealed` / `makeTransfer`** → *plan-derived*, from an inert
  `BalancedPlan`: the wallet's inputs netted against its own change and outputs. This
  **includes the DUST fee** the transfer burns, so a `sum(|diff|)` cap sees the whole
  movement. For `makeTransfer` the plan is sized on demand at the seam — the outputs are
  **mock-proven** (proofs are fixed-size, so the fee is exact) and the balancing is planned
  against the wallet's synced UTXOs, so **no real proving happens before the gate**. It does
  mean the seam **syncs the wallet and selects inputs** for a `makeTransfer`; a transfer the
  wallet cannot fund fails at planning, before the gate ever runs.
- **`makeIntent`** → *request-derived*, from the declared inputs (outflow) and self-outputs
  (inflow). A maker offer is deliberately imbalanced and **pays no fee** (the taker does), so
  the request already is the complete movement — there is nothing to plan.
- **`balanceSealedMerge`** (a fully-sealed maker completed by merging) → the taker's own half,
  request-derived like `makeIntent`, **plus the DUST fee the merge burns** (when `payFees` on a
  live-DUST chain). The fee covers the whole merged tx and the maker never pays, so it is sized
  against a **mock-proven taker complement** — fixed-size proofs give the exact fee with no real
  proving — and folded in as a dust outflow, so a `sum(|diff|)` cap sees the burn.

Shielded value a dapp routes back to the wallet is netted in as well: the base offers'
outputs are trial-decrypted with the shielded viewing key and each recognized receipt is
keyed by the segment its offer executes in. Without it the list would only carry the wallet's own
balancing contribution, over-stating outflow — a conservative cap bound rather than the
wallet's true net. Recognizing a receipt needs no spend key.

There is deliberately **no flat, segment-summed view**. Summing the segments discards the
guaranteed-versus-fallible distinction, which is the whole point of what the seam hands a
policy: a fallible inflow must never be allowed to offset a guaranteed outflow. See
[policy-create.md](./policy-create.md) for how a policy is expected to read this, for
the sibling `chain_extra.contracts` list that answers *who* the transaction talks to, and for
`chain_extra.dust_registrations`, the DUST registrations the DApp asks the wallet to sign.

So a `makeTransfer` of `V` NIGHT to someone else nets to `-V` in NIGHT plus the DUST fee it
burns — the NIGHT matching the recipient's on-chain credit `+V` (change returns to self).
Verified against a real broadcast: a 1,000,000-NIGHT transfer credited the recipient exactly
1,000,000 — see `e2e/results-2026-07-16.md`, "effects-vs-actual".

## The second policy pass in detail (Midnight 3)

`enforce_effect_policies` (`ows-lib/src/key_ops.rs`) is the gate `prepare_signable_tx`
runs at the plan→authorize seam. It fills the plan's per-segment movement into the
transaction context under `chain_extra` — leaving the flat `effects` field empty, since
the wallet can only account for its **own** movement, not the transaction's full effects —
and calls `evaluate_executable_policies`: **only the executable policies**, not the
declarative rules (those already gated the request shape in the first pass). A denial
returns a `PolicyDenied` error, so the key is never used to prove anything.

This is what lets a policy express a rule like *"cap the summed movement at 1,000,000"* —
a rule that is impossible to enforce at the first pass, because the first pass sees empty
effects; the real movement is only known after planning. See [policy-create.md](./policy-create.md).

## How this differs from other chains

| | Other chains | Midnight |
|---|---|---|
| `--tx` input | hex unsigned tx bytes | **JSON** DApp Connector request |
| What signing produces | a signature | a fully **sealed** transaction (`SignResult.transaction`) |
| Who balances / pays fees | the caller | the **wallet** (fees in dust) |
| Proof | none | zero-knowledge proofs built at authorize time |
| Policy passes | one (request shape) | **two** (shape, then effects) |

## Validation

Connector methods — cases **B1–B4** (`e2e/dapp-connector-siblings.md`, re-run live in
`e2e/results-2026-07-16.md` Suite B). These need a local prover, a funded wallet, and the
indexer, so they run by hand on preview:

| Case | Method | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| B1 / B1n / B1s | `makeTransfer` unshielded self / non-self / shielded custom token | ✅ broadcast (3 on-chain txhashes) |
| B2 | `makeIntent` imbalanced maker, sealed via `sign tx` | ✅ |
| B3a | `balanceSealed` with a fully-sealed maker | ✅ merged (taker complement + merged dust fee) |
| B3b | `balanceSealed` with a proven (`proof,embedded-fr`) maker | ✅ balanced + sealed |
| B4a | `balanceUnsealed` with `proof,embedded-fr` | ✅ balanced + sealed |
| B4b | `balanceUnsealed` with `proof-preimage` | ✅ rejects (out-of-spec error) |

Second policy pass — cases **C1–C2** (`e2e/policy-second-pass.md`, re-run in
`e2e/results-2026-07-16.md` Suite C):

| Case | Case | Result |
|------|------|--------|
| C1 | Over-cap (5,000,000 > 1,000,000) → **denied at the second pass**, no prover/network | ✅ `policy denied: summed movement 5000000 (cap 1000000)` |
| C2 | Under-cap (500,000) → **passes the gate**, fails later in authorize | ✅ (an authorize-stage error, *not* "policy denied") |

The effect-recording policy captured the two-pass behavior directly: pass 1 sees `[]`
(empty effects), pass 2 sees the key-derived `[{diff:[["00…00", "-value"]]}]`, with the
pass-2 magnitude equal to the declared transfer value exactly.
